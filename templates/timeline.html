        <h2>A Historical Journey</h2>
        <p>Everyone around the globe is affected by the lack of nuclear energy implementation and pollution from fossil fuels. In the US, air pollution from other power plants is the worst in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida (Walter).</p>

            <h3>Dec. 20, 1951: First Electricity from a Reactor</h3>
            <p>In Idaho, at the National Reactor Testing Station, an experimental nuclear reactor provided power for the building it occupied. It did not provide power for a grid and remained classified. (Ellison)</p>

                    <p>Three Mile Island was a reactor in Pennsylvania that, due to a cooling failure, had a partial meltdown. No one died but this event did start and fuel anti-nuclear protests and sentiments. (Ellison)</p>

            <h3>Apr. 26, 1986: Chernobyl Meltdown</h3>
            <p>Reactor 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant in Ukraine exploded after a flawed test. The power surge caused an explosion in the core and tons of radiation was released. Around 30 people died in the first three months because of radiation. This was the last major human error accident to occur. (Ellison)</p>

                    <p>On Mar. 11, 2011, an earthquake caused a tsunami to hit the Japanese Fukushima Daiichi I nuclear power plant. The flooding led to emergency generators failing, causing loss "of the cooling agent" (Ellison).</p>

      <h2>Michael D.</h2>
      <p>
        Michael D. is currently a junior at Central Carolina Academy with a goal
        to enter the engineering field. Michael D. became obsessed with nuclear
        energy, going into lots of research, and saw just how useful and
        beneficial nuclear energy was as a zero emission energy source. Outside
        of School, Michael likes to read books, play video games on the Xbox,
        and practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

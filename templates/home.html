        <h1>Yesterday's Myths, Today's Reality:<br />The Truth About Modern Nuclear Power</h1>
        <p>Accurate information about today's reactor designs can change public perception</p>

        <h2>Brief Summary</h2>
        <p>The focus of modern-day energy production is to find an energy source that can produce enough energy while being green. Nuclear power only generates 12 grams of carbon dioxide per kWh, which is about 68 times less than coal's output of 820 grams of carbon dioxide per kWh ("Carbon Dioxide Emissions From Electricity"). Currently, fossil fuels dominate the field of energy production with ~60%, renewables at 31%, and nuclear at just 9% in 2024 (Héctor et al 1-2).</p>
        
        <p>Despite the safety, energy output, environmental friendliness, and readiness of modern nuclear power, it's opposed by the U.S. public because of fear and skepticism holding it back. Accurate information about today's reactor designs can change that.</p>

        <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p><strong>How can accurate public understanding of modern nuclear power's benefits beat the public's skepticism and fear, leading to nuclear energy's adoption as an energy source?</strong></p>

      The failure to implement modern nuclear reactors does not just harm the
      atmosphere, it affects everyone across the U.S. Energy sources that
      produce high amounts of pollution, like coal and gas, are still very
      prevalent today. Coal leads to 161 fatalities per TWh whereas nuclear is
      only at 0.04 fatalities per TWh, even when factoring in events such as the
      Chernobyl meltdown (Héctor et al 17). Everyone is affected, but the most
      affected are young children and the elderly who are more susceptible to
      pollution-related diseases (WHO).

      <h2>A Real Story: The Bharti Family</h2>
      <p>
        Khushboo Bharti, 31, is the parent to her one year old daughter Samaira.
        Ms. Bharti details how in the middle of the night "I remember her waking
        up with a violent cough that made her vomit several times" (Yadav). None
        of the "usual home remedies" worked and she ended up taking her to the
        hospital (Yadav).
      </p>

      <p>
        "On the way there, Samaira didn't react to anyone or anything. It was
        very unlike her, she is a bubbly child. She wouldn't even lift her head.
        It was the worst moment of my life" (Yadav).
      </p>

      <p>
        At the hospital, Samaira was eventually diagnosed with pneumonia, was
        treated with a "strong steroid nebulization" and was on oxygen support
        for two days (Yadav). Ever since, Ms. Bharti is on edge and panics
        "[e]ven if she coughs just a few times" (Yadav).

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p>
      Stories like the Bharti family's are not isolated incidents. Air pollution
      from fossil fuel-based energy production affects millions of families
      worldwide, particularly in areas near coal and gas power plants (WHO). The
      choice between nuclear energy and fossil fuels has direct consequences for
      public health, especially for vulnerable populations like children and the
      elderly.
